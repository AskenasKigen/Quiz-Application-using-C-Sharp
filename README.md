# Quiz-Application-using-C#
I was approached by a Sea Life Centre who wanted to promote knowledge on sea animals to children.
As part of their services, the company decided to distribute games or quizzes to their membersâ€™ children, and they were looking to hire contractor developers to build them.
I and my partner were shortlisted to get our first job as contractor developers for this company and to convince the company manager that we were the right people for the job, we were required to design and implement ONE game or quiz as a standalone application using the C# programming language.
